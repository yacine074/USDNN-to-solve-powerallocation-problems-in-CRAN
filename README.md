## Abstract
In  this  paper,  an  unsupervised  deep  learning  approach  is  proposed  to  solve  the  constrained  and  non-convex rate maximization problem in a relay-aided cognitive   radio network. The network under study is composed by a primary, respectively a secondary, user–destination pair and a secondary full-duplex relay performing Decode-and-Forward. The primary communication is protected by imposing a Quality of Service(QoS) constraint in terms of primary Shannon rate degradation. The relaying operation is highly non linear  and leads to a non-convex objective function and primary QoS constraint, which makes deep learning approaches relevant and promising to solve such a difficult problem. For this,  we propose a fully-connected neural network and a custom loss function to be minimized during training. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed neural network has a high generalization capability on unseen data, with no over-fitting effects. Also, the predicted solution performs close to the optimal one obtained by bruteforce.
